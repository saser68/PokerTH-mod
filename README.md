This project is a modification (mod) of the original PokerTH code, specifically designed to restore and improve compatibility with the latest versions of Android.

Since the original development became outdated for current Android systems, this mod updates critical libraries and configuration settings to make the game functional again on modern mobile devices.

⚠️ Security and Transparency Notice

To ensure maximum user security and software integrity:

    No pre-compiled APK file is provided.

    This repository contains the source code, .so libraries, and the asset structure.

    Instructions: The end user must process these folders, generate the APK package, and sign it manually using their own development tools (such as Android Studio or Qt for Android).

This approach ensures that the user has full control over what they install on their device, verifying that the code has not been altered by third parties.
